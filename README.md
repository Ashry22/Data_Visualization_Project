## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. While illustrating the data, we would refer to trip durations over 60 mins as Long Trips and that less than 60 mins as Short Trips.


## Summary of Findings

>1. Most company customers are born between 1985 to 1995.
>2. Male customers are more than female customers.
>3. Customer retention descreases at Saturdays and Sundays, although most of long trips happen at them.
>4. Customers tend to use bikes for longer durations between 9 A.M to 8 P.M.
>5. It seems that females average usage duration at short trips is higher than the average for males.
>6. Customers average usage duration at short trips is higher than average for subscribers.
>7. Usage durations are almost the same over week day at short trips.
>8. Usage duration are very high during Fridays, Saturday & Sundays at long trips.
>9. Average picking and dropping rates are the same for different stations.
>10. Older males' trip durations are longer than that for old females.
>11. Females' trips duration at Wednesdays are longer than any other day of the week for the long trips.
>12. Customer types tend to use bike over longer duration at Saturdays and Sundays.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> 2. Customer retention descreases at Saturdays and Sundays, although most of long trips happen at them. So, promotions could help increase retention rate at these days.
>3. Customer types tend to use bike at long trips at Saturdays and Sundays.
